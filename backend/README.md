# Challenges


## Computer Science & Competitive Programming

1. Build an LRU Cache. Get detailed requirements at https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache/

2. Lowest Common Ancestor at https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/

3. Write an algorithm to flatten an Array, and one to flatten an object. (turn all keys into top level keys)

## Code Design

Coding design challenges prompt the candidate to navigate ambiguity and general implementational knowledge. Solutions can be evaluated in usefulness, coding fluency and communication. 

1. Design and Implement a command line's argument parser. The parser should allow named and unnamed parameters and parameter validation.

2. Resolve [FindParent](https://silverdev.notion.site/Challenge-FindParent-59672103482c4675be9ba6b532241785?pvs=4)
   
3. Design and Implement a Rate Limiter Middleware. The rate limiter receives a Req object, and can return if the response should be rate limited or not. Consider concepts like client retries, tolerance, and caching when designing this component.


## Modeling and API Design

1. Design & Implement a Banking Service. The service should allow to make accounts, deposits, withdrawals, and account transfers

2. Design an API version of Whatsapp. Write pseudocode to explain what each endpoint would execute.

## API implementation challenges 

The rest API is available at https://docs.github.com/en/rest?apiVersion=2022-11-28 - you will need to have and authenticate your github account.

1. Github Developer Rater

Create a scripting that evaluates a developer's GH profile and outputs a rating from 1-5 based on his public information. The rating calculation is up to you, but you are encouraged to use the users activity like commits, prs, comments as well as the size and quality of his contributions.

Input: a username or github url
Output: a 1-5 rating

1. Github Package Rater

Create a scripting that evaluates a repository and outputs a rating from 1-5 based on his public information. The rating calculation is up to you, but you are encouraged to use the repository activity, issue count, merged prs and any other information available in the API.

Input: a username or github url
Output: a 1-5 rating
