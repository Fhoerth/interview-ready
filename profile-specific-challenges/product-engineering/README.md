# Wallet Signup Flow

We are going to build a digital wallet web-based signup flow. You are tasked with designing, implementing and deliverying a usable demo of a signup flow.
We want to see your ability to envision and ship a digital product.

Example from V0:

## Requirements

Build a uniquely flavored user experience for handling user registration and KYC verification. Think of the audience for your experience and write the copy and build the experience around it. Original additions are encouarged.

The experience must be deployed and usable from a public-facing landing where the user can initiate the signup flow.

The flow must include getting the following information from the user:
1. User / Email registration
2. KYC verification information: name, full address, date of birth, and government ID

** IMPORTANT **

The flow must include error handling and loading states. Include the following use cases:

1. Email: alreadytaken@gmail.com -> "Email is already taken"
2. Country: Uruguay -> "This country is not supported"
3. Form Submissions, mocked or otherwise, should have at least 200ms of delay.

## Evaluation Criteria
- User experience and polish
- Technical Depth & Quality
- Product Sense & Thinking

The experience must be the best you can produce - errors in states, flows, or designs will affect your scoring significantly.

## Tips & Tricks
- Use your preferred tech stack. We want to evaluate the product on the technical implementation.
- The prompt is purposefully ambiguous to encourage creative solutions. Bring your own ideas and creativity to the table.
- Use of AI is encouraged, but pay attention to quality.
- No third-party integrations are necessary - you can mock responses from your own server or client.
