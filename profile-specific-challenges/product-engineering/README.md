# Wallet Signup Flow

We are going to build a digital wallet web-based signup flow. You are tasked with designing, implementing and deliverying a usable demo of a signup flow.
We want to see your ability to envision and ship a digital product.

## Requirements

Build an experience for handling user registration and KYC verification.

The experience must be deployed and usable from a public facing landing where the user can initiate the signup flow.

The flow must include getting the following information from the user:
1. User / Email registration
2. KYC verification information: name, full address, date of birth, and government ID

The flow must include error handling and loading states. Include the following use cases:

1. Email: alreadytaken@gmail.com -> "Email is already taken"
2. Country: Uruguay -> "This country is not supported"
3. Form Submissions, mocked or otherwise, should have at least 200ms of delay.

## Evaluation Criteria
- User experience and polish
- Technical Depth & Quality
- Product Sense & Thinking

The expeirence must be the best you can produce - errors in states, flows or designs will affect your scoring significantly.

## Tips & Tricks
- Use your preferred tech stack. We want to evaluate the product over the technical implementation.
- The prompt is purposefully ambiguous to encourage creative solutions. Bring your own ideas and creativity to the table.
- Use of AI is encouraged, but pay attention to quality.
- No third-party integrations are necessary - you can mock responses from your own server or client.
