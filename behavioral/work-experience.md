# Work Experience

Work experience interviews aim to evaluate the depth of a candidate's career. These are the hardest interview to prep for in the sense that they aim to evaluate your past, not your potential.

Work experience is about story telling, and about being thorough to explain what you have done in the past.


## Presentations

Sometimes you have the opportunity to present, and it would be great to build a slide deck or diagrams about what you did.

This is my original presentation for my interview at Scribd in 2013: [Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSY6JO6lYbaPK877GV7s69X6hrIrnREzfmEmrNjKhOn-cFf38PY3qTeQNS8YDAu812BBnNUVkDpsIyz/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000)

A good presentation is engaging, fun, and explains decisions and depth of understanding. Correctness is secondary - it is very hard to evaluate correctness in this context, so you are evaluated on depth of understanding and communication.

A check list for a good topic & presentation:

- [ ] Did you design and build it?
- [ ] Can you present and explain technical decisions you made?
- [ ] Do you understand the system/solution end to end?
- [ ] Can you present it in short and long form?
- [ ] Does it show technical depth or breath?
- [ ] Do you have hard numbers on usage, revenue, complexity?


## Product Thinking

Product interviews are mostly cultural interviews about what interests the candidate and what they understand of a business as a whole, as well as having taste and sensibility to what is new and innovative.

A candidate that **only writes code** is unnappealing to small startups that want profiles that have passion for what they are building and can bring ideas to innovate and help the business.

It is very unlikely to pass a product thinking interview without experience building and marketing systems on your own, or working at a startup. However, there are things you can do to prep to understand the basics.

We discuss this topic on the podcast on these episodes:

A checklist to cover your bases:

- [ ] Install, purchase and use the product. What works and what doesn't - what are opportunities for growth?
- [ ] Check investors, company investment round and PR releases about funding
- [ ] Check the industry. Is the sector doing well? Is the product a sub-set of another sector? What makes the product unique because of the industry that it operates in?
- [ ] Check direct and indirect competitors. Evaluate market share, quality of product, growth, strategy.
