# Work Experience

Work experience interviews aim to evaluate the depth of a candidate's career. These are the hardest interview to prep for in the sense that they aim to evaluate your past, not your potential.

Work experience is about story telling, and about being thorough to explain what you have done in the past.



## Presentations

Sometimes you have the opportunity to present, and it would be great to build a slide deck or diagrams about what you did.

This is my original presentation for my interview at Scribd in 2013: [Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSY6JO6lYbaPK877GV7s69X6hrIrnREzfmEmrNjKhOn-cFf38PY3qTeQNS8YDAu812BBnNUVkDpsIyz/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000)

A good presentation is engaging, fun, and explains decisions and depth of understanding. Correctness is secondary - it is very hard to evaluate correctness in this context, so you are evaluated on depth of understanding and communication.

A check list for a good topic & presentation:

- [ ] Did you design and build it?
- [ ] Can you present and explain technical decisions you made?
- [ ] Do you understand the system/solution end to end?
- [ ] Can you present it in short and long form?
- [ ] Does it show technical depth or breath?
- [ ] Do you have hard numbers on usage, revenue, complexity?
