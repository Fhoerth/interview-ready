# Behavioral Interviews

In any interview process candidates are evaluated for their soft skills - communication, storytelling, experience leading and working in teams, conflict resolution and more.

A behavioral screening can be as short as 15 minutes, though experienced candidates are expected to have great content to share to stretch an interview to 45 minutes.

A framework on how to think about this is provided in the draft podcast episode [Narrativa Personal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CNtLDbGMUmeQjKmmOZuxB4GF0pUe7zxyWy51BT1pTEY/edit#heading=h.4kuthmkwi01w). 

You can also consult the [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://github.com/conanbatt/interview-practice/tree/main/coding-challenges/cracking-the-coding-interview/book) book that has an entire unit dedicated to Behavioral Interviews.

We recomend you record yourself answering this videos, so you can see how you come across.
